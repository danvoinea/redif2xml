Title: Globalisation, Tradition And Cultural Identity In Spanish Football: Reflections And Observations
Abstract: This article offers some reflections and observations on the complex relationship between the forces of Globalisation and Spanish football, posing the key question as to whether the impact of Globalisation has been a quintessentially corrosive dynamic, eroding the quasi - sacrosanct traditions of the Spanish game to fashion a distinctive post- modern pastiche of elitism and inequality based on an orgy of consumption and commodity.

Title: Overcoming The Children's Mourning State Through Psychological Intervention
Abstract: Death and mourning that follows it are experiences that occurs in everyone`s life at one time. There are unavoidable, painful, sad experiences even for adults who are able to manage their own emotions, and evenmore for children who, at least in early childhood and elementary school aren't able to understand on their own what it's happening in that moment, and how to manage their sadness and live the mourning period properly. Due to the fact that children are not yet fully developed cognitively, cannot understand on their own the concept of death. At that age, death seems for them not to be permanent. Children believe that death is a reversible process that the person in their family is temporarily left and they will return at any moment, and they will wait and ask for that moment long after the actual death, if lacked of any other information. Moreover, children think that death is avoidable, since - at that age, self-centeredness is somehow a characteristic of their personality and death hasn't affected their own person; therefore, when death occurs in their family, their reality will be brutally shaken and they will be very disoriented. Also, in early childhood, kids have a symbolic, magical perspective about death; they imagine it as a devil, a monster or a black lady with a scythe and many other images, far from a realistic perspective. Considering this aspects, it is very important that a realistic, honest, adapted to their age perspective of death when it affects their family. Unfortunately, in many cultures, death is still a taboo. It still exists the belief of overprotecting children from suffering by hiding the death of a close family member, lying them and taking them far away so that they cannot see the dead person. But actually, by practicing this, parents, teachers and persons around the children only make him be more disoriented and suffer more by not knowing what happened with the person they love. As a parent or teacher, it is very important to understand that staying beside the children and sustaining him emotionally, without hiding him any aspect about death of the loved one has a crucial importance for their future development; otherwise, it is probable that they will develop symptoms of chronic depression, and as adults, problems of attachment and extreme fear of death. Proper education for population regarding this delicate subject is a sign of a developed society. In the light of this perspectives, specialists and psychotherapists should be prepared to offer advice and support in any moment so that parents will be learn how to stand by their children in the hard and long process of managing their negative emotions, living their mourning together.

Title: A Possible Barrier In Extending The Process Of Lifelong Learning (Lll)
Abstract: The process of accumulating cognitive and socio-emotional proficiencies is accomplished mainly during the first period of a person's life. These proficiencies assure a basis for the ulterior accumulation of specific skills through vocational and technical education, superior education and lifelong learning. Employees have limited access to information about their training opportunities, and employers do not benefit of stimuli so that they might offer a professional formation. A comparative approach regarding necessary skills categories on labor market may be very useful from the education and formation point of view.

Title: Penal Policies In Bulgaria And Poland
Abstract: The contemporary european studies underline the necessity of adoption of an european model, in order to assure the compliance with the fundamental rights and liberties of people deprived of liberty. But the visions of the model favour one of the two opposite tendencies, which are invariable present in theoretical debates and penal politics: on one hand, the use of  the deprive of liberty as a mean to avoid the repetition of an offense and on the other hand, the compliance with the fundamental rights of people deprived of liberty. The article proposes the analysis from a theoretical perspective the European penal politics' impact on the penal politics from Bulgaria and Poland, member states of the European Union. Within this context, it is important to mention the fact that the selection of the two states is underlay on the hypothesis according to which the theoretical and empirical knowledge of the European penal politics' impact on the national penal politics is not developed from the sociological perspective.

Title: Local And European Identity In The Regional Press
Abstract: The study assesses the way the mission of Europeanization is assumed by the press. From this perspective, it is shown that the media has an educational role, even one of emancipation, transgressing the absolute expectation of informing. The study proposes a re-interpretation of the social involvement of journalism, recognizing a pertinent role in setting up the civic and mentality values at local and regional levels. The speech of the online written press was monitored with precise reference to the most important publications in two regions: Oltenia (Romania) and Valencia (Spain).  We understood the journalistic texts as interpretation actions that generate meaning for a community. The thematic fields circumscribing the key terminology were analyzed, texts were evaluated in terms of perspective and of socio-emotional proximity graphics and we have demonstrated the need of subsuming of so-called 'European journalism' with the more complex 'social journalism'.

Title: How The Message Becomes Part Of The Communication Process
Abstract: This study argues in favour of the thesis according to which the message is not directly perceived and it does not occur immediately within the communication process. We can notice that, in order to receive and understand the message, we need to follow a process concerned with the initiation into the process of comprehending the message: we receive the message after having established a hermeneutic situation and determined an instance of discourse. The message will not become obvious implicitly, within the reality of comprehension: it is not conveyed as such, as the sender does not simply deliver a message; the message takes shape within the processing of the significations used in the communicational transaction.

Title: The Public Broadcaster And The Dynamics Of The Romanian Radio Market
Abstract: The permanent changing of the listening habits of the population and the rapid technological evolution represent a real challenge for the Romanian public radio. That is the reason why the editorial management of the public broadcaster should find the proper strategy to keep up with the transformations constantly taking place in the domestic radio market. Adapting to the New Media paradigm is a vital matter to any radio station, including the public one. Therefor the modern ways of reaching more audience should be a priority for the management of the public broadcaster, especially when the dynamics of the radio market are often spectacular and rather unpredictable. That is why the editorial strategy of the public radio must focus on the constant improvement of both the editorial offer and the means of transmission. The "battle" for rating and market share can be won only by constant adjusting and readjusting the policy of the radio station and by permanently improving the structure and the content of the radio programs.

Title: A Review Of The History Of Gender Equality In The United States Of America
Abstract: Gender inequality is one of the important challenges in all modern societies, the United States of America being no exception, despite the progress and significant advances that have been made in the past century. There still is a significant gender gap in many areas - most notable being the pay gap, social norms and practices, education, political participation and social institutions. The present article aims to analyse the legal framework and social framework that has evolved in the United States of America in order to diminish or completely abolish gender inequality and discrimination. After the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, which empowered women with political rights, there was a proposed amendment to the Constitution to guarantee equal rights for women, first introduced in Congress in 1923, passed by both houses in 1972, but which failed ratification - only 35 out of the 38 states needed ratified the amendment before the deadline - 1979, which later was extended to 1982. The United States has since taken some steps in reducing the gender gap and stopping gender discrimination: in 1963 it passed the Equal Pay Act, that prohibited pay discrimination based on sex, the next year the Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination, including when based on sex, and Title IX of the Educational Amendments in 1972, which provided equal federal financial assistance indiscriminate of sex.  This legislation helped shape the United States into one of the frontrunners in gender equality, even if in 2014 it ranked on the 20th place according to the Global Gender Gap Index.
