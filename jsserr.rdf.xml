In addition to stating that grit is an important factor in measuring the intelligence and the success. At the same time they have stressed that the grit is much more important predictors of success. Even Duckworth and Quinn (2009) argued that grit is more effective than intelligence scores for explainig the success. There are some studies that they are advocating grit is closely associated with self-discipline, self-regulation and goal orientation, and grit is the main factor for exlaining that concpts(Duckworth &amp; Quinn, 2009; Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004). In this study, university student success and their grit's are analysed. Therefore, determining the relationship between success and grit is used for descriptive screening model.

There are unavoidable, painful, sad experiences even for adults who are able to manage their own emotions, and evenmore for children who, at least in early childhood and elementary school aren't able to understand on their own what it's happening in that moment, and how to manage their sadness and live the mourning period properly. Due to the fact that children are not yet fully developed cognitively, cannot understand on their own the concept of death. At that age, death seems for them not to be permanent. Children believe that death is a reversible process that the person in their family is temporarily left and they will return at any moment, and they will wait and ask for that moment long after the actual death, if lacked of any other information. Moreover, children think that death is avoidable, since - at that age, self-centeredness is somehow a characteristic of their personality and death hasn't affected their own person; therefore, when death occurs in their family, their reality will be brutally shaken and they will be very disoriented. Also, in early childhood, kids have a symbolic, magical perspective about death; they imagine it as a devil, a monster or a black lady with a scythe and many other images, far from a realistic perspective. Considering this aspects, it is very important that a realistic, honest, adapted to their age perspective of death when it affects their family. Unfortunately, in many cultures, death is still a taboo. It still exists the belief of overprotecting children from suffering by hiding the death of a close family member, lying them and taking them far away so that they cannot see the dead person. But actually, by practicing this, parents, teachers and persons around the children only make him be more disoriented and suffer more by not knowing what happened with the person they love. As a parent or teacher, it is very important to understand that staying beside the children and sustaining him emotionally, without hiding him any aspect about death of the loved one has a crucial importance for their future development; otherwise, it is probable that they will develop symptoms of chronic depression, and as adults, problems of attachment and extreme fear of death. Proper education for population regarding this delicate subject is a sign of a developed society. In the light of this perspectives, specialists and psychotherapists should be prepared to offer advice and support in any moment so that parents will be learn how to stand by their children in the hard and long process of managing their negative emotions, living their mourning together.</abstract><fullTextUrl format="html">http://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-2-36-47.pdf</fullTextUrl><keywords language="eng"><keyword>death</keyword><keyword> mourning</keyword><keyword> sadness</keyword><keyword> emotional management</keyword><keyword> psychotherapy</keyword><keyword> psychological intervention</keyword></keywords></record>

That is the reason why the editorial management of the public broadcaster should find the proper strategy to keep up with the transformations constantly taking place in the domestic radio market. Adapting to the New Media paradigm is a vital matter to any radio station, including the public one. Therefor the modern ways of reaching more audience should be a priority for the management of the public broadcaster, especially when the dynamics of the radio market are often spectacular and rather unpredictable. That is why the editorial strategy of the public radio must focus on the constant improvement of both the editorial offer and the means of transmission. The "battle" for rating and market share can be won only by constant adjusting and readjusting the policy of the radio station and by permanently improving the structure and the content of the radio programs. </abstract><fullTextUrl format="html">http://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-2-137-142.pdf</fullTextUrl><keywords language="eng"><keyword>radio market</keyword><keyword> romanian radio</keyword><keyword> public radio</keyword><keyword> public broadcaster</keyword></keywords></record>

There still is a significant gender gap in many areas - most notable being the pay gap, social norms and practices, education, political participation and social institutions. The present article aims to analyse the legal framework and social framework that has evolved in the United States of America in order to diminish or completely abolish gender inequality and discrimination. After the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America, which empowered women with political rights, there was a proposed amendment to the Constitution to guarantee equal rights for women, first introduced in Congress in 1923, passed by both houses in 1972, but which failed ratification - only 35 out of the 38 states needed ratified the amendment before the deadline - 1979, which later was extended to 1982. The United States has since taken some steps in reducing the gender gap and stopping gender discrimination: in 1963 it passed the Equal Pay Act, that prohibited pay discrimination based on sex, the next year the Civil Rights Act, which outlawed discrimination, including when based on sex, and Title IX of the Educational Amendments in 1972, which provided equal federal financial assistance indiscriminate of sex.  This legislation helped shape the United States into one of the frontrunners in gender equality, even if in 2014 it ranked on the 20th place according to the Global Gender Gap Index.</abstract><fullTextUrl format="html">http://sserr.ro/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3-2-143-149.pdf</fullTextUrl><keywords language="eng"><keyword>equality</keyword><keyword> gender equality</keyword><keyword> gender legislation</keyword><keyword> equal rights amendment </keyword></keywords></record>
